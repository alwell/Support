Abhidhamma in the Scriptures
----------------------------

We read in the “Kindred Sayings” (Saḷāyatana Vagga, Kindred Sayings
about Feeling, Book I, § 7, Sickness):

> Once the Exalted One was staying near Vesālī, in Great Grove, at the
> Hall of the Peaked Gable.
>
> Then the Exalted One at eventide rising from his solitude went to
> visit the sick-ward, and on reaching it sat down on a seat made ready.
> So seated the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:—
>
> \`\`Monks, a monk should meet his end collected and composed [^1].
> This is our instruction to you. And how, monks, is one collected?
>
> Herein, monks, a monk dwells, contemplating the body in the body…
> feeling in the feeling… consciousness in consciousness… dhamma in
> dhamma, ardent, composed and thoughtful, having put away in this world
> the dejection arising from craving. Thus, monks, is a monk collected.
>
> And how, monks, is a monk composed?
>
> Herein, monks, in his going forth and in his returning a monk acts
> composedly. In looking in front and looking behind, he acts
> composedly. In bending or relaxing (his limbs) he acts composedly. In
> wearing his robe and bearing outer robe and bowl, in eating, drinking,
> chewing, and tasting he acts composedly. In easing himself, in going,
> standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, in speaking and keeping silence
> he acts composedly. Thus, monks, is a monk composed.
>
> Monks, a monk should meet his end collected and composed. This is our
> instruction to you.
>
> Now, monks, as that monk dwells collected, composed, earnest, ardent,
> strenuous, there arises in him feeling that is pleasant, and he thus
> understands: ‘There is arisen in me this pleasant feeling. Now that is
> owing to something, not without cause. Owing to what? Owing to this
> same body. Now this body is impermanent, compounded, arisen owing to
> something. It is owing to this impermanent body, which has so arisen,
> that pleasant feeling has arisen as a consequence, and how can that be
> permanent?’
>
> Thus he dwells contemplating impermanence in body and pleasant
> feeling, he dwells contemplating their transience, their waning, their
> ceasing, the giving of them up. As he thus dwells contemplating
> impermanence in body and pleasant feeling, contemplating their
> transience… the lurking tendency to lust for body and pleasant feeling
> is abandoned.
>
> So also as regards painful feeling… the lurking tendency to repugnance
> for body and painful feeling is abandoned.
>
> So also as regards neutral feeling… the lurking tendency to ignorance
> of body and neutral feeling is abandoned.
>
> If he feels a pleasant feeling he understands: ‘That is impermanent, I
> do not cling to it. It has no lure for me.’ If he feels a painful
> feeling he understands likewise. So also if he feels a neutral
> feeling.
>
> If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it as released from bondage
> to it.
>
> So also, if he feels a painful feeling and a neutral feeling, he feels
> it as one released from bondage to it.
>
> When he feels a feeling that his bodily endurance has reached its
> limit, he knows that he so feels. When he feels a feeling that life
> has reached its limit, he knows that he so feels. He understands: When
> body breaks up, after life is used up, all my experiences in this
> world will lose their lure and grow cold.
>
> Just as, monks, because of oil and because of a wick a lamp keeps
> burning, but, when oil and wick are used up, the lamp would go out
> because it is not fed. Even so, monks, a monk, when he feels a feeling
> that his bodily endurance has reached its limit, that his life has
> reached its limit, when he feels a feeling that, when body breaks up,
> after life is used up, all his experience in this world will lose its
> lure and grow cold,- he knows that he so feels.”

This sutta contains the essence of the Buddha’s teaching: the
development of satipatthāna, right understanding of mental phenomena and
physical phenomena, which leads to the eradication of all defilements.
Just as a lamp will go out when oil and wick are used up the person who
has eradicated defilements will not be reborn.

The Buddha taught about the realities which can be directly experienced
in daily life when they appear, such as seeing, hearing, feeling,
hardness or sound. All these phenomena are real in the absolute or
ultimate sense. Absolute or ultimate truth is different from
conventional truth [^2]. If one has never heard of the Buddha’s
teachings one only knows what is real in conventional sense. We think of
ourselves and of the world around us, of people, animals, trees, and
they seem to last. The world, person, animal or tree are real in
conventional sense. The world and everything in it can only appear
because consciousness arises just for a moment, thinks about it and then
falls away immediately. Consciousness, in Pāli : citta, is real in the
absolute sense. The Buddha taught that in the absolute sense our life
consists of mental phenomena, in Pāli: nāma, and physical phenomena, in
Pāli: rūpa. Citta is nāma, it experiences an object, whereas rūpa does
not experience anything. There are no mind and body which last and which
belong to a self or person; what we take for our mind and body are only
different nāmas and rūpas, each with their own characteristic which can
be experienced one at a time when it appears. They arise because of
their appropriate conditions and then fall away immediately. They are
impermanent and they do not belong to a self, they have no owner. There
is only one citta arising at a time, but each citta is accompanied by
several mental factors, in Pāli: cetasikas. Both citta and cetasika are
nāma. Some cetasikas, such as feeling and remembrance accompany each
citta, whereas unwholesome qualities such as attachment and aversion
accompany only unwholesome cittas and wholesome qualities such as
kindnes, generosity or understanding accompany wholesome cittas. Citta
cannot arise without cetasikas and cetasikas cannot arise without citta,
they condition one another. They arise together, experience the same
object and then fall away together. Thus, what we call “person” is
actually citta, cetasika and rūpa which arise and fall away. Citta,
cetasika and rūpa are the three paramattha dhammas which are
conditioned: they arise because of conditions and then fall away. There
is a fourth paramattha dhamma which is unconditioned, which does not
arise and fall away and this is nibbāna. Nibbāna is the reality which
can only be experienced at the moment enlightenment is attained.

The development of right understanding of what is real in the ultimate
sense is the only way leading to the eradication of defilements. When we
study the scriptures, no matter whether it is the Vinaya, the Book of
Discipline for the monks, the Suttanta or Discourses, or the Abhidhamma,
we should never forget this goal. The Vinaya contains rules and
guidelines for the monk’s behaviour which can help him to reach
perfection, the state of the arahat, who has eradicated all defilements.
The Suttanta or Suttas are discourses of the Buddha to people of
different levels of understanding at different places. In these
discourses the Buddha speaks about birth, old age, sickness and death.
He speaks about the suffering in the world and the cause of all
suffering which is craving. He explains what is unwholesome and what is
wholesome or beneficial, he points out the danger of defilements and the
way to eradicate them by the development of understanding of all that is
real. The Abhidhamma contains the description of all mental phenomena
and physical phenomena of our life, their different conditioning factors
and the way they are related to each other.

In the Abhidhamma all paramattha dhammas, ultimate realities, are
enumerated and classified in detail, but also in the Suttas the Buddha
explained about paramattha dhammas, about nāma and rūpa, in order to
help people to gain understanding. The Suttas are mostly, but not
entirely, in terms of conventional language. The Buddha knew the
different accumulated inclinations of people and thus he chose the
wording best suited to the persons addressed. He spoke to monks,
laypeople, brahmins and philosophers who adhered to other beliefs. He
made use of parables or of examples of events in daily life in order to
help people to understand paramattha dhammas. Right understanding of
paramattha dhammas should be developed in order to eliminate wrong view
of realities. The study of the Abhidhamma helps us to have more
understanding of what the Buddha taught in the suttas.

Not all people were ready to grasp what paramattha dhammas are, and
therefore the Buddha would give them a “gradual discourse”, or a
discourse “in due order”. We read, for example in the “Verses of Uplift”
(Khuddaka Nikāya, Minor Anthologies), Ch V, 3, that, when the Buddha was
staying near Rājagaha, in Bamboo Grove, a leper, named Suppabuddha, saw
from afar that the Buddha was teaching dhamma to a great many people. He
wanted to draw near the crowd, hoping to obtain some food. He noticed
that there was no alms-giving, but that the Buddha was teaching dhamma
and then he decided to listen. We read:

> Now the Exalted One, grasping with his mind the thoughts of all that
> assembly, said to himself: Who, I wonder, of those present is of
> growth to understand dhamma? And the Exalted One saw Suppabuddha, the
> leper, sitting in that assembly, and at the sight he thought: This one
> here is of growth to understand dhamma. So for the sake of
> Suppabuddha, the leper, he gave a talk dealing in due order with these
> topics: on almsgiving, virtue, the heaven world, of the danger,
> meanness and corruption of sense-desires, and the profit of getting
> free of them.
>
> And when the Exalted One knew that the heart of Suppabuddha, the
> leper, was ready, softened, unbiassed, elated and believing, then he
> unfolded those dhamma-teachings which the awakened ones have
> themselves discovered, namely: Dukkha, arising, ending, the Way.
>
> Then just as a white cloth, free from stains, is ready to receive the
> dye, even so in Suppabuddha, the leper, as he sat there in that very
> seat, arose the pure, stainless dhamma-sight, the knowledge that
> whatsoever is of a nature to arise, that also is of a nature to end.
> And Suppabuddha, the leper, saw dhamma, reached dhamma, understood
> dhamma, plunged into dhamma, crossed beyond doubting, was free from
> all questionings, won confidence, and needing none other in the
> Master’s message [^3], rose from his seat, advanced to the Exalted One
> and sat down at one side…

Suppabuddha listened to the Buddha’s exposition of the four noble
Truths: dukkha, the cause of dukkha, the cessation of dukkha and the way
leading to the cessation of dukkha which is the eightfold Path [^4].
While Suppabuddha listened he attained the first stage of enlightenment,
the stage of the sotāpanna. He could not have attained enlightenment if
he had not known what dhammas, realities, are. While he was seeing and
hearing he had to be aware of the nāmas and rūpas which were appearing
and he had to penetrate their true nature. He could attain enlightenment
because he had accumulated wisdom also in past lives.

We cannot understand the deep meaning of the suttas if we have no basic
understanding of the paramattha dhammas as they have been described in
the Abhidhamma. We cannot understand what has been stated in this sutta
about Suppabuddha’s enlightenment if we do not know that citta, cetasika
and rūpa, thus, paramattha dhammas, are the objects of insight.
Suppabuddha had to clearly know the difference between the
characteristics of nāma and rūpa as they appeared one at a time, and he
had to realize them as conditioned realities before he could penetrate
their impermanence, their nature of dukkha and of non-self [^5]. It
takes an endlessly long time, even many lives, to develop understanding.
However, a moment of understanding is never lost, it is accumulated. In
the Seventh Book of the Abhidhamma, the “Paṭṭhāna”, translated as
“Conditional Relations”, different types of conditions for realities
have been taught. One of these is the contiguity-condition
(anantara-paccaya): each citta which arises is a condition for the
succeeding one by way of contiguity-condition. Defilements and good
qualities which arose in the past, even in past lives, are accumulated
from one moment of citta to the next one, since each citta conditions
the following one by way of contiguity-condition. The Abhidhamma
clarifies how we accumulate different inclinations and how they
condition the cittas arising at the present time.

We read further on that Suppabuddha went away after having heard the
discourse and was then killed by a calf. When the monks asked the Buddha
about Suppabuddha’s rebirth the Buddha explained that he was a
sotāpanna, bound for full enlightenment. A sotāpanna cannot be reborn in
an unhappy plane. The monks then asked why he was born as a poor,
wretched leper. The Buddha answered that in a former life he had
insulted a “Silent Buddha”. Because of that deed he was reborn in hell
and in his last life he was born as a leper. In that life he became a
sotāpanna and then he was reborn in a heavenly plane.

We read in this sutta about kamma which produces result, but it is a
subject which is difficult to understand. The study of the Abhidhamma is
most helpful to gain more understanding of the different conditions for
the nāmas and rūpas of our life, including the condition of kamma which
produces vipāka. We have read in the above-quoted sutta about the result
Suppabuddha received when a calf caused his death. Not only pain felt at
an accident is vipāka, but also seeing, hearing and the other
sense-impressions are vipāka. They are vipākacittas arising time and
again in daily life. The Abhidhamma teaches in detail about all the
different types of kusala cittas, of akusala cittas and of cittas which
are neither kusala nor akusala, including vipākacittas, and about all
the different cetasikas which accompany cittas. We learn about the
different objects cittas experience through the senses and the
mind-door, and about the defilements arising on account of what is
experienced. Also in the suttas we read about the experience of objects
through the senses and the defilements which arise, but without the
study of the Abhidhamma we cannot fully understand the sutta texts. I
will illustrate this with a quotation from another sutta. We read in the
“Kindred Sayings” (IV, Saḷāyatana Vagga, Kindred Sayings on Sense,
Second Fifty, Ch 5, § 98, Restraint) that the Buddha said to the monks:

> I will teach you, monks, restraint and lack of restraint. Do you
> listen to it. And how, monks, is one unrestrained?
>
> There are, monks, objects cognizable by the eye, objects desirable,
> pleasant, delightful and dear, passion-fraught, inciting to lust. If a
> monk be enamoured of them, if he welcome them, if he persist in
> clinging to them, thus should he understand: “I am falling back in
> profitable states. This was called ‘falling back’ by the Exalted One.”
>
> (the same is said with regard to the other sense-doors and the
> mind-door.)
>
> And how, monks, is one restrained?
>
> There are objects cognizable by the eye… If a monk be not enamoured of
> them, if he welcome them not, … thus should he understand: “I am not
> falling back in profitable states. This was called ‘not falling back’
> by the Exalted One.” Thus, monks, is one restrained.

The Abhidhamma helps us to understand the different functions of cittas
arising in a process of cittas which experience objects through the six
doors. In a process of cittas which experience an object through one of
the sense-doors there are moments of vipāka and there are kusala cittas
or akusala cittas which arise on account of the object which is
experienced. The cittas arising in such a process arise each because of
their own conditions and in a fixed order; there is no self who can
direct the arising of particular cittas. There is no self who is
unrestrained or restrained. When we read about the monk who is enamoured
of the objects experienced through eyes, ears, or through the other
senses, we may not realize that we all have attachment time and again
after seeing, hearing and the other sense-impressions. When we read the
above-quoted sutta with understanding of different cittas arising in
processes we will see that this sutta reminds us of our defilements
arising in daily life, even at this moment. If we do not know that
defilements and wholesome qualities are cetasikas, conditioned
realities, we may take them for self. We may cling to a concept of self
who is practising the eightfold Path, whereas in reality wholesome
cetasikas are performing their functions. We read in the suttas about
the exertion of energy or effort for what is wholesome and about right
effort of the eightfold Path. If we do not know that effort is a
cetasika which can arise with akusala citta as well as with kusala citta
there are bound to be many misunderstandings concerning the development
of kusala and in particular the development of the eightfold Path. We
read, for example, in the “Gradual Sayings” (II, Book of the Fours, Ch
II, § 3, Effort)[^6]:

> There are four right efforts, O monks. What four?
>
> Herein, a monk rouses his will not to permit the arising of evil,
> unwholesome states that have not arisen- to abandon evil, unwholesome
> states already arisen- to arouse wholesome states that have not yet
> arisen- to maintain wholesome states already arisen and not allow them
> to disappear; he makes an effort (for it), stirs up his energy, exerts
> his mind and strives.

Someone may believe that whenever he tries to develop the eightfold Path
there is right effort which is wholesome, but in reality there may be
effort arising with akusala citta rooted in attachment, he may take
effort for “my effort”. Mindfulness arises because of its appropriate
conditions, not by trying to make it arise. When awareness and right
understanding of nāma and rūpa arise there is at that moment also right
effort which accompanies the kusala citta. Thus, it is essential to
study details of cetasikas which accompany the different types of citta.
The study of the Abhidhamma can help us to have a more precise
understanding of the realities of daily life.

Some people doubt whether the Abhidhamma is the Buddha’s teaching. The
commentator Buddhaghosa explains[^7] that the Buddha, at the attainment
of enlightenment, penetrated the truth of all realities, and that he in
the fourth week after his enlightenment contemplated the contents of the
seven books of the Abhidhamma. He preached the Abhidhamma first to the
devas of the heavenly plane of the “Thirtythree”, headed by his mother.
After that he conveyed the method of the Abhidhamma to Sāriputta.

Thus, the codified Abhidhamma literature as we have it today goes back
to the Buddha’s chief disciple Sāriputta. When we study the Abhidhamma
and the suttas and compare them, we will notice that also numerous
suttas are in terms of paramattha dhammas, dealing with the khandhas
(aggregates), the elements, the sense-fields (āyatanas) and the cittas.
Also the Vinaya deals with cittas and with many different degrees of
defilements which can accompany citta. The Vinaya reminds the monk to
scrutinize himself, to be aware also of akusala cittas. While the monk
goes out to collect almsfood and while he accomplishes his daily tasks
he should develop mindfulness and understanding of nāma and rūpa. All
three parts of the Buddhist scriptures are in conformity with each
other, they help people to develop right understanding of all realities,
each in their own situation of life. Historical reasons may not cure
doubts about the authenticity of the scriptures, but careful examination
and consideration of the contents of the Buddhist teachings themselves
can convince us of their authenticity and their immense value for the
development of the way leading to freedom from all suffering.

When someone takes up the first book of the Abidhamma, the
\`\`Dhammasangaṇi \`\`, translated as “a Buddhist Manual of
Psychological Ethics”, he may feel confused about the many
classifications and enumerations of cittas, of their accompanying
cetasikas and of rūpas. These are not abstract categories just to be
read and memorized, but they are realities which arise time and again in
daily life. When they appear they can be objects of awareness and right
understanding. The development of satipatthāna, right understanding of
nāma and rūpa as impermanent, dukkha and non-self, is the aim of the
teaching of the Abhidhamma. The first book of the Abhidhamma should be
read together with its commentary the “Atthasālinī”, translated in two
volumes as “The Expositor”. The great commentator Buddhaghosa, who lived
in the sixth century A.D., wrote this commentary. The footnotes of the
translation of the first book of the Abhidhamma refer to the
corresponding parts in its commentary, and the reader will see for
himself that the commentary is most helpful for the correct
understanding of the Abhidhamma[^8]. Buddhaghosa came from India to Sri
Lanka where he edited and rendered into the Pāli language ancient
Singhalese commentaries he found there. The commentaries to most of the
Buddhist scriptures are from his hand, but they are based on the ancient
commentaries. The “Visuddhimagga”, an encyclopedia of the teachings
written by Buddhaghosa, which is translated as “The Path of
Purification”, and also the “Abhidhammattha Sangaha”, a compendium of
the Abhidhamma written by Anuruddha [^9], are of great assistance for
the understanding of the Abhidhamma.

In the above-quoted sutta on restraint and lack of restraint we read
that the monk who is not enticed by pleasant objects is restrained.
Someone may have restraint by temporarily suppressing his likes and
dislikes, but when there are conditions for defilements they will arise
again. Only through the development of right understanding of realities
can there be restraint which is enduring. The development of
satipatthāna is exclusively the teaching of the Buddha and thus this is
implied in all parts of the scriptures, also when it is not expressively
mentioned. We read in the “Middle Length Sayings” (II, 97, Discourse
with Dhānañjāni) that Sāriputta taught the brahman Dhānañjāni when he
was sick about the meditations which are the “Divine Abidings” of
lovingkindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity. With these
meditations, when they are developed, jhāna or absorption can be
attained. However, jhāna is not the goal of the Buddha’s teachings. We
read that the Buddha said to Sāriputta:

> “But why did you, Sāriputta, although there was something further to
> be done, having established the brahman Dhānañjāni (only) in the less,
> in the Brahma-world, rising from your seat, depart?”
>
> “It occurred to me, Lord: ‘These brahmans are very intent on the
> Brahma-world. Suppose I were to show the brahman Dhānañjāni the way to
> companionship with Brahmā?’”
>
> “Sāriputta, the brahman Dhānañjāni has died and has uprisen in the
> Brahma-world.”

This sutta reminds us not to forget the goal of the Buddha’s teachings,
that is: the eradication of defilements through the development of
satipatthāna. We cannot understand any sutta if we do not begin to
develop understanding of the nāma or rūpa which appears in our daily
life. In the following sutta the importance is stressed of listening to
the teachings, considering them and putting them into practice. We read
in the “Kindred Sayings”(II, Nidāna-vagga, Ch XX, Kindred Sayings on
Parables, § 7, The Drum-peg) that the Buddha said to the monks:

> Once upon a time, monks, the Dasārahas had a kettle-drum called
> Summoner. As it began to split the Dasārahas fixed in ever another
> peg, until the time came that the Summoner’s original drumhead had
> vanished and only the framework of pegs remained.
>
> Even so, monks, will the monks become in the future. Those Suttantas
> uttered by the Tathāgata, deep, deep in meaning, not of the world,
> dealing with the void, to these when uttered, they will not listen,
> they will not lend a ready ear, they will not bring to them an
> understanding heart, they will not deem those doctrines that which
> should be learnt by heart, that which should be mastered.
>
> But those Suttantas which are made by poets, which are poetry, which
> are a manifold of words, a manifold of phrases, alien, the utterances
> of disciples, to these when uttered they will listen, they will lend a
> ready ear, they will bring an understanding heart, they will deem
> these doctrines that which should be learnt by heart, which should be
> mastered. Thus it is, monks, that the Suttantas uttered by the
> Tathāgata, deep, deep in meaning, not of the world, dealing with the
> void, will disappear.
>
> Wherefore, monks, you are thus to train yourselves:— To these very
> Suttantas will we listen, will we give a ready ear, to these will we
> bring an understanding heart. And we will deem these doctrines that
> which should be learnt by heart, and mastered:— even thus.

The Buddha’s teachings will disappear by wrong understanding of them and
by wrong practice. Today we are fortunate that we still have access to
the teachings. Therefore, we should not neglect to study them and to put
them into practice.
