How do you know these books represent the truth of Buddhism? The best you can do is check them with original teachings and verify them with the truth of reality now. All our books have many quotes from the original scriptures. See this link for a sutta from the Buddha about this problem. [Maha Paranibbana Sutta](https://github.com/alwell/Zolag_Archive/blob/master/Mah%C4%81parinibb%C4%81naSutta.md)
